## ✨ Features

- Search bar remains hidden until the user clicks the search icon
- Clicking outside the input hides it again
- Background color changes when search is active
- Uses `useState` for managing UI state

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML + CSS for basic styling
- `react-icons` (for the search icon, e.g., `FaSearch`)
